# Merlyx
The first iteration of the (eventual) Merlyx compiler! Merlyx is a programming language designed mainly because
we want to experiment with making a language that actually works, and to be more Python/Nim-like, to be closer
to our languages of choice!

## To-Dos
These will be crossed off as they are completed.
- Fix the lexer
- Create the parser
- Create the JVM backend codegen (via Jasmin/Jasm?)
- Rewrite the compiler in Merlyx once the first iteration reaches a 'stable'/usable state
